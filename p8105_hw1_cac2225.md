Problem 1
=========

Writing a chunk of code to define the variables within the dataframe.

First running the library package tidyverse so that the function tibble will be available.

Then naming the dataframe and starting the tibble function.

Seed is set to 1 so that results are reproducible.

Within the dataframe, "random\_sample\_ten" is the name of the random sample of 10 numeric values, taken from the uniform distribution of 0 to 5, using the runif function.

Next the, the logical vector "greater\_than\_2" is defined based on the values that "random\_samp\_ten" will generate. Values within random\_samp\_ten that are greater than 2 will return a value of "True" within greater\_than\_2's column, while values within random\_samp\_ten that are equal to or less than 2 will return a value of "False".

A character vector, "random\_words", that is length 10 is defined.

A factor vector, "color\_cat", that comprises of ten different catagory labels is defined and turned into a factor using the factor function.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## -- Attaching packages ------------------------- tidyverse 1.2.1 --

    ## v ggplot2 3.0.0     v purrr   0.2.5
    ## v tibble  1.4.2     v dplyr   0.7.6

    ## v readr   1.1.1     v forcats 0.3.0

    ## -- Conflicts ---------------------------- tidyverse_conflicts() --
    ## x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
    ## x dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()

``` r
set.seed(1)

problem1_df = tibble(
  random_samp_ten = runif(10,0,5),
  greater_than_2 = random_samp_ten > 2,
  random_words = c("My", "name", "is", "Courtney", "Chan","and", "I", "love", "data", "science"),
  color_cat = factor(c("red","orange","yellow","green","blue","indigo","purple","black","white","grey" ))
)
```

Upon running this chunk of code, a table is generated in the environment with the four corresponding columns for each variable: ten random numeric values generated from the runif function, corresponding categorization of the ten random values as either greater than or equal to/less than 2 under a logical vector column, the 10 character vector and the 10 character factor vector.

The next chunk of code will try to take the mean of each variable in the dataframe.

``` r
mean(problem1_df$random_samp_ten)
```

    ## [1] 2.757569

``` r
mean(problem1_df$greater_than_2)
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
mean(problem1_df$random_words)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(problem1_df$random_words): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(problem1_df$color_cat)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(problem1_df$color_cat): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

The mean function can be applied to the random\_samp\_ten variable and to the greater\_than\_2 variable. The random\_samp\_ten variable is numeric and contains a list of numbers and thus the mean of these numbers can be calculated. greater\_than\_2 is a logical vector, that can be coded numerically, thus each "True" becomes a 1 and each "False" becomes a 0. The mean can then be taken and can be interpreted as a proportion of 1's within the list.

The mean function cannot be applied to the random\_words variable because it is a character variable - it is comprised of letters and does not have a numeric meaning. Nor can it be applied to the color\_cat variable because it is a factor variable, which are seen as catagories. Neither of them are numeric or logical variables - it would not make mathematical sense to try and calculate a mean value using non-numeric values.
