Problem 1
=========

Creating the dataframe
----------------------

Writing a chunk of code to define the variables within the dataframe.

First running the library package tidyverse so that the function tibble will be available.

Then naming the dataframe and starting the tibble function.

Seed is set to 1 so that results are reproducible.

Within the dataframe, "random\_sample\_ten" is the name of the random sample of 10 numeric values, taken from the uniform distribution of 0 to 5, using the runif function.

Next the, the logical vector "greater\_than\_2" is defined based on the values that "random\_samp\_ten" will generate. Values within random\_samp\_ten that are greater than 2 will return a value of "True" within greater\_than\_2's column, while values within random\_samp\_ten that are equal to or less than 2 will return a value of "False".

A character vector, "random\_words", that is length 10 is defined.

A factor vector, "color\_cat", that comprises of ten different catagory labels is defined and turned into a factor using the factor function.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## -- Attaching packages ------------------------- tidyverse 1.2.1 --

    ## v ggplot2 3.0.0     v purrr   0.2.5
    ## v tibble  1.4.2     v dplyr   0.7.6
    ## v tidyr   0.8.1     v stringr 1.3.1
    ## v readr   1.1.1     v forcats 0.3.0

    ## -- Conflicts ---------------------------- tidyverse_conflicts() --
    ## x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
    ## x dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()

``` r
set.seed(1)

problem1_df = tibble(
  random_samp_ten = runif(10,0,5),
  greater_than_2 = random_samp_ten > 2,
  random_words = c("My", "name", "is", "Courtney", "Chan","and", "I", "love", "data", "science"),
  color_cat = factor(c("red","orange","yellow","green","blue","indigo","purple","black","white","grey" ))
)
```

Upon running this chunk of code, a table is generated in the environment with the four corresponding columns for each variable: ten random numeric values generated from the runif function, corresponding categorization of the ten random values as either greater than or equal to/less than 2 under a logical vector column, the 10 character vector and the 10 character factor vector.

Taking the Means
----------------

The next chunk of code will try to take the mean of each variable in the dataframe.

``` r
mean(problem1_df$random_samp_ten)
```

    ## [1] 2.757569

``` r
mean(problem1_df$greater_than_2)
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
mean(problem1_df$random_words)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(problem1_df$random_words): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(problem1_df$color_cat)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(problem1_df$color_cat): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

The mean function can be applied to the random\_samp\_ten variable and to the greater\_than\_2 variable. The random\_samp\_ten variable is numeric and contains a list of numbers and thus the mean of these numbers can be calculated. greater\_than\_2 is a logical vector, that can be coded numerically, thus each "True" becomes a 1 and each "False" becomes a 0. The mean can then be taken and can be interpreted as a proportion of 1's within the list.

The mean function cannot be applied to the random\_words variable because it is a character variable - it is comprised of letters and does not have a numeric meaning. Nor can it be applied to the color\_cat variable because it is a factor variable, which are seen as catagories. Neither of them are numeric or logical variables - it would not make mathematical sense to try and calculate a mean value using non-numeric values.

Applying the as.numeric function
--------------------------------

``` r
as.numeric(problem1_df$greater_than_2)
as.numeric(problem1_df$random_words)
as.numeric(problem1_df$color_cat)
```

As per instructions, the chunk is shown but the output is not, using eval = FALSE.

Upon applying the as.numeric function to the logical vector greater\_than\_2, instead of being recorded as "true" and "false," they're recoded as 1s and 0s. When the as.numeric function is applied, the character vector random\_Words values, are recoded as NA. Applying as.numeric to the factor vector color\_cat, causes the values to be recorded as numbers based on their alphabetical order. The as.numeric function tries to coerce variables into being defined as numeric.

``` r
as.numeric(as.factor(problem1_df$random_words))
```

    ##  [1]  8  9  6  3  2  1  5  7  4 10

``` r
as.numeric(as.character(problem1_df$color_cat))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

    ##  [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

After the catagory variable, random\_Words, has been converted to a factor variable, and then numeric, its conversion follows the previous code's pattern. The random\_words take on an alphabetical order as a factor vector and are numbered as such upon being converted to a numeric vector.

The factor vector color\_cat, becomes a character vector, which upon being converted into a numeric vector can only display NA. There are no numerical values that can be associated with it.
